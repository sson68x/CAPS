## Project: Event Drive Applications

### Author: Simon Son

### Problem Domain

* Setup a pool of events and handler functions, with the intent being to refactor parts of the system throughout the week, but keep the handlers themselves largely the same. The task of “delivering a package” doesn’t change (the handler), even if the mechanism for triggering that task (the event) does.
